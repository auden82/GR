      The GR III’s 28mm equivalent lens is perfect for landscapes. It offers a wide field of view without distortion, ideal for capturing expansive scenes, dramatic skies, or layered compositions. Its APS-C sensor ensures excellent detail and dynamic range, and the compact body makes it a go-anywhere tool for hikers, travelers, or urban explorers.<br><br>

    What camera settings are ideal?

    <p>
      Use Aperture Priority (Av) mode and set the aperture to f/5.6–f/8 for sharpness front to back. ISO 100 is best for clean, detailed images. Use manual focus with focus peaking for precision, or use snap focus set to 2.5m or infinity. Consider using a 2-second self-timer to minimize camera shake when handholding or using a mini tripod.<br><br>

    How to stabilize for sharpness?

    <span style="display: block; line-height: 0.5;">&nbsp;</span>
    <p>
      While the GR III has in-body stabilization, for maximum sharpness use a lightweight tripod or rest the camera on a stable surface. Disable shake reduction when using a tripod. Use the 2-sec timer or remote app to avoid introducing movement when pressing the shutter. Sharpness matters most in landscapes—stability makes a big difference.<br><br>

    How should I compose?

    <p>
      Use the rule of thirds and include foreground elements—rocks, water, trees—for depth. The GR III’s wide field is great for leading lines and dramatic skies. Try vertical compositions for mountains or forests. Set the level indicator on in the menu to help keep your horizon straight, especially when shooting handheld.<br><br>

    What lighting works best?

    <p>
      Shoot during golden hour—early morning or late afternoon—for softer light, long shadows, and vibrant colors. Overcast conditions work well for moody scenes and forest shots. Avoid harsh midday sun unless you're going for high contrast. Use the GR’s Highlight-weighted metering to preserve sky detail in brighter scenes.<br><br>
