      GR users are more than camera owners—they’re a community of passionate, observant photographers around the world. From street shooters to portrait artists, GR users share a respect for everyday moments, personal style, and the value of carrying a camera always. Whether online or in person, the GR community connects through a shared creative spirit.<br><br>

      GR Meetups are informal photo walks and gatherings hosted by GR users and Ricoh Imaging. They take place in cities around the world and give photographers a chance to meet, shoot, share, and learn from each other. Whether you're new to the GR or a long-time user, it's a welcoming space to connect with others who see the world through a similar lens.<br><br>

Through community events, shared stories, and real-world photography, we aim to be part of your creative journey, not just a tool in your bag. Join the culture—not just the camera.<br><br>
