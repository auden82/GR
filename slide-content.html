    <p>The GR philosophy is that confrontation with society is the essence of photography, and art is merely the result. And the moment when chance becomes necessity, a piece of art becomes something that transcends time. Image quality and response are the means to respond to the photographers intentions. The camera is fine in a supporting role. Good photos are born of various eras, countries, areas, and devices, but the feeling they portray never fades, but rather the strength they embody grows stronger with time. Because of this, the most important quality a camera can have is neutrality. It should assimilate into the photographers eyes, hands, and heart.<br> <span style="display: block; line-height: 0.5;">&nbsp;</span>

      <p>A photo is a record of light. The important thing for a camera is to capture the various types of light in the world, as is. However, this also means that a camera should not do so excessively. No matter how advanced the digital technology, the GR believes that the most important facets of a camera are a lens that collects light, and optical performance. The power to communicate the appeal of an object resides in a photo taken through a good lens.<br><br>

      <p>The GR knows that the basis of shooting photos is the snapshot. What drama awaits one second in the future The ability to react to that moment is the appeal, and depth of a photo. In taking snapshots, there is no such thing as a pro or amateur. The important thing is sensibility and instantaneous force. Snapshots embody the aggregate of true pleasure of photography. Always carry a camera that can respond quickly, and capture high quality images. The GR will continue to strive to be the pinnacle in snapshot cameras.<br><br>

   What is 28mm fixed focal length?

      <p>28mm is the perfect angle of view for capturing photos of society. It is also the perfect perspective to make the main subjects, whether they are people or objects, stand out from around the visual fields of both eyes. It is quite simply the perfect angle of view for a snapshot camera. While focusing on a fixed focal length, we have not compromised one iota on image quality. Sometimes this means that the photographer must take another step closer to the main subject, but that is also what a snapshot is all about. Sharp and decisive footwork to get up close, and sometimes dare to put a bit of distance between you and the subject. That, we believe, is the true essence of photography. equivalent to 28mm in the 35mm format.<br><br>

      <p>When thinking of readiness to capture a photo opportunity, there isnt much sense in timing the speed of each specific operation independently. Portability that allows the camera to be taken out anywhere, button layout for basic one-handed operation, start-up and shut-down speed, extremely short shutter time lag, high-speed focus, inner barrier, and sufficient battery life. Each aspect that affects the total response time should be balanced. For example, the GR is ready and able to respond to those decisive moments just around the corner. What kind of photo can you capture when the best image quality meets the best mobility? Isnt it exciting just to imagine?<br><br>

      <p>An excellent camera is one that works in concert with the users intention, always providing comfortable feedback. For cameras, that means an agile response, a comfortable grip, pleasant controls, optimized button and control layout, and the flexibility to customize the functions to match its use. These reflect the photographers intent, and help in stress-free operation. The better you get to know the ins and outs of such a camera, the more you can make it suit your style. For these reasons, a good camera is a hard thing to let go of. In some cases, you may be inspired by the potential of this tool and become more motivated to take photographs, and a camera like that could come to be called your favorite thing. The GR puts emphasis on the details that cannot be expressed in the specifications of the catalog.<br><br>

      <p>The GR knows that excellent What is emotion?Even if technology can excite us, technology alone cannot continue to shake the hearts of man over and over again. It can be said that how much love is put into a product is important. The GR was born not simply of concepts that rely on the power of technology, or manufacturing processes devised by marketing techniques, but from what we believe the ideal snapshot camera should be. The fact that a photo recorded in this small camera can move many people, in turn moves us, and gives us the power to press forward onto the next challenge to make an even better GR. is design that is unobtrusive. Good design speaks of the essence of a thing, and of the values of the owner. The GR does away with ostentation, keeping a simple, functional design. The GR design may seem to be relatively unchanged, however, this is not because we have decided never to change it. The design evolves along with the goal of the best possible design. We hope you never tire of it no matter how long you use it, and that it becomes a part of you, a partner that youll never let go of.<br><br>
